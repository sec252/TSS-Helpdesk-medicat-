Login VB script to automate login process  on a public  workstation

Problem: On start up or restart automatically login into Medicat software to remove the need of a technitian to physically access the workstation. (O.S : Windows 10)

Proposed Solution: Create a VB script that will input the log in information  on start up by adding the .vbs file to the list of application to run on start-up.
